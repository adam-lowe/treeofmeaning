        <h2>Dear Reader, </h2>
        <i>Welcome to thetreeofmeaning.org, a website dedicated to advancing our understanding of natural (human)
        languages and the role they play in human cognition. The premise of the website is that the reductionist lens
        mischaracterizes the true nature of languages. This website argues/maintains that languages are integrated
        systems of meaning (“Meaning Systems”) that we live inside of, and through which we perceive and interpret the mindexternal
        world. (Continued in ‘About’ Tab above)</i>
